        <p class="project-p">At the International School of Krakow, a pre-K through grade 12 school of 228 students, theexisting central issue was falling short in size and support facilities to support a growing school and student population to the board-approved increase of nearly 30% of existing numbers. The current facilities, already hard-pressed to accommodate existing class sizes, were evaluated to find solutions to accommodate the growth as well as create 21st century learning spaces. Master plan projects included creating small learning communities to better organize the school, a new elementary school wing, a new athletics wing, and a central school community courtyard.</p>
