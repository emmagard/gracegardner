        <p class="project-p">The Oak Grove School District, a large elementary school district in San Jose, CA,  sought to achieve massive district-wide upgrades and modernizations to their campuses in order to create an improved 21-st century approach to learning throughout.  Programming for District included 19 campuses and the District offices and set out to identify each campus' individual needs, strengths and weaknesses, in order to prioritize funding, projects and identifying areas of district-wide commonalities.</p>
