        <p class="project-p">The Kentfield School District, a 2-school district in Marin County, CA, consisting of an elementary school and a middle school, sought programming and outreach services to fully integrate the school stakeholders, staff, students and community into the master plan process.  The district goals included creating more classrooms to address project growth trends as well as modernize existing facilities to support 21st century learning and curriculum.  Individual programming meetings were held with stakeholders to identify user-experience needs and desires and community meetings were held to create community buy-in and understanding of the process and the resulting master plan.</p>
