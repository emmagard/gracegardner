        <p class="project-p">Bishop O'Dowd High School sought to update their existing Master Plan through programming to ensure its position as a school of the future that is successfully preparing students for a
        diversifying and ever-changing world of 2050.  The school faced challenges to creating new educational spaces due to site-constraints of the existing campus location and how to accommodate 1,200 students without significantly raising tuition.  Through programming the school was able to determine their next priorities and new programs including offering more flexibility for students to meet their learning needs, more online-learning classes, more college course offerings, an expanded environmental studies and STEAM program, expanded athletic fields and facilities, and creating or adapting existing spaces to be more student-centered, independent work-oriented as well as incorporating a flexible technology infrastructure needed to support evolving innovations in teaching and learning.</p>
